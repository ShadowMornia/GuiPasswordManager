This code is a Python script that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application for managing passwords using the Tkinter library and SQLite for database storage. Here's an English description of the code:

1. Import necessary modules:
   - `tkinter`: for creating the GUI.
   - `messagebox` and `simpledialog` from `tkinter`: for displaying messages and dialogs.
   - `sqlite3`: for working with the SQLite database.
   - `sys`: for handling command-line arguments.

2. Define the master password, which is provided as a command-line argument.

3. Define a function `sql_connection` to establish a connection to an SQLite database named 'passwordManager.db'.

4. Define a function `sql_table` to create a table named 'passwords' in the database if it doesn't already exist. The table has columns for website, username, and password.

5. Call the `sql_connection` and `sql_table` functions to connect to the database and create the 'passwords' table.

6. Define a `submit` function for adding password records to the database. It inserts data into the 'passwords' table and clears the input fields if all fields (website, username, and password) are filled.

7. Define a `query` function to query the password records from the database. It asks for the master password, and if it matches, it retrieves and displays all password records in a label. The records are formatted with ID, Website, Username, and Password columns.

8. Define a `hide` function to clear the displayed password records when the "Hide Records" button is pressed.

9. Create a Tkinter window and set its title, size, and constraints.

10. Create a frame within the window for organizing widgets.

11. Create input fields (Entry widgets) for entering website, username, and password.

12. Create labels for the input fields.

13. Create buttons for adding passwords and showing/hiding password records.

14. Create a label (query_label) to display the stored password records within the frame.

15. Define a `main` function to start the Tkinter main loop.

16. Check if the script is the main program (not imported) and call the `main` function to start the GUI application.

This code provides a basic password management system with GUI for adding and viewing stored passwords. The passwords are stored in an SQLite database, and access is controlled using a master password.
